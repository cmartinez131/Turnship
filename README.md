## Overview
### Description
Turnship is an app that streamlines the process of candidates finding internships. It breaks down the search process by allowing users to put hashtags on either their candidate profile or their internship/job listing. With this hashtag, our algorithm will match candidates and listings with matching hashtags or similar profile keywords. Candidates will use a Tinder-style system to determine their decision (swipe right to apply to the internship, swipe left to dismiss the internship, swipe up to save the internship and decide later). If a user applies for an internship through our system, we'll share their profile to various recruiters within the same company in order to make a decision. It will show up as pending under a different tab while this decision is being made. If a recruiter accepts a candidate, a messaging system will be opened up between the recruiter and the candidate, allowing either the recruiter or the candidate to send the first message and continue with the application process. Companies will have to set their job posting to a limited amount of time in order to minimize backend data taken up (1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year). Candidate profiles will be made up of their skills, projects, education, names, a brief description, and pictures if a user chooses to upload one.
